# apriori-algorithm

Apriori Algorithm is an algorithm for extracting the frequent item-sets with application in association rule learning. In general, the apriori algorithm has been developed to work on databases containing large number of transactions. For instance, purchases by customers of a store. The item-set is considered as ‘frequent’ if it meets a user-specified support threshold. For example, if the support threshold is set to 0.4, this indicates that a frequent item-set which is defined as a set of items that found together in at least 40% of all transactions in the database.
